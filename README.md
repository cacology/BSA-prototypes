# BSA Prototypes
A bunch of prototypes for BSA "digital humanities tools" including the website.

This repository can contain files, trials, issues, etc. for the digital initiatives committee for the BSA.  The intent is to identify problems in `Issues` and just dump solutions here as we try them out.

All members can edit anything!
